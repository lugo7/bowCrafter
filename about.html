             <p>This site is for me to keep track of how to make different kinds of bows for when I want to
               build them, as currently I don't have the time for this sort of project. But it would be amazing
               if this site can help anyone else interested in making their own bow and arrow. </p>
            <p>Being very interested in how so many civilizations independently discovered how to make the
              bow and arrow, I researched the process of making one from scratch. This made me very interested
              in making one myself. So I made a self bow that at least looked like a bow, but like any craft,
              skill, and patience are required.</p>
